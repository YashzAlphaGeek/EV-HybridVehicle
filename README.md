# EV-Hybrid Vehicle

Hybrid vehicles have two power sources Engine and motor. It takes advantage of each power source and the power sources compensate for each other's shortcomings. It doesn't require external charging and no special infracture is required.

+ More Power - IC Engine helps
+ More Fuel - Motor helps

### Needs of Hybrid Technology
+ Growth of the global automation market - <b> Good Fuel Economy </b>
+ Increased production of CO2 - <b> ECO CAR </b>
+ Increase need for energy in the form of fossil fuels - <b> Low Carbon Emission </b>

## Electric vs Petrol vehicle

### Electric Vehicle
 
 + Uses an electric <b> motor </b> that directly drives the vehicle
 + Very powerful and self-starting
 + <b> Motor Efficiency is 90% </b>
 + Induction motor speed is up to 18000 rpm which can directly drive the wheels
 + Weight - 32 kg, Power - 270 KW, Power/Weight - 8.5KW/Kg
 + <b> Brain of electric car is Inverter </b> It vary speed by varying frequency of motor
 + While slowing down or braking, 3 phase motor gets energy /power from the wheels and it works as a generator to recharge the battery
 + The Cost of electric cars is higher as premium quality cells are used in the battery
 + Single Transmission while reverse gear motor will rotate in reverse direction as inverter changes phase sequence

### Petrol Vehicle

 + Uses a piston which converts linear into <b> rotary motion </b> and a flywheel is attached to it
 + Need another DC motor to rotate the flywheel and start the vehicle
 + <b> Engine efficiency is 35-40% </b>
 + Limited RPM so that's why it is connected to transmission to increase speed
 + Weight - 110 kg, Power - 140 KW, Power/Weight - 0.8KW/Kg
 +  <b> The BRain of the IC engine is transmission/gears which vary the speed of the vehicle </b>
 + Brakes have no effect on vehicle
 + IC engine is low compared to EV
 + For the back gear, we have the transmission in which we change the direction of rotating gears
 
## Electric vs Hybrid vehicle

### Electric Vehicle

 + EV solely works on the electric motor
 + Drives by the power delivered by an electric motor
 + Battery is charged off-board from the source when it's plugged and with regenerative braking
 + Large Battery
 + Excludes engine, gas tank, fuel equipment etc.
 + Less maintenance than a hybrid because of very few moving parts
 + Better economical and efficient for long travels

### Hybrid Vehicle

 + Hybrid = Electric + Gasoline Engine (IC)
 + Electric motors sometimes power the car to delay the use of petrol engines and save fuel
 + Standard Hybrid - Use Regenerative BRaking / Plugin Hybrid - Regenerative Braking and Power from external source
 + Lower Battery
 + Fully generated IC engine
 + More maintenance than electric as there are more equipment and moving parts
 + More efficient at saving money when your commute is short due to limited battery range
 
## Components of hybrid vehicle

+ Exhaust System
+ Internal Combustion Engine
+ Power Electronics Controller
+ DC/DC Converter
+ Thermal System (Cooling)
+ Battery
+ Transmission
+ Electric Generator
+ Electric Traction Motor
+ Traction Battery Pack
+ Fuel Tank
+ Fuel Filter

### HV Battey Assembly
Stores electricity generated by MG1 & MG2

### Power Management Control ECU

+ Used to control the hybrid system and integrated with the power management control ECU
+ Receives information about driver inputs and vehicle driving conditions from each centre as well as from various ECUs.

### Engine
High Efficient Atkinson cycle engine. Produces power to drive the vehicle and generates electricity.

### Inverter with converted assembly
+ Boost Converter
+ Inverter
+ DC/DC Converter

### MG1 (Generator)

Generates electricity using engine power. Functions as a starter to start the engine

### MG (Motor)

+ Supplements the power of the engine to enhance driving performance. When driving the vehicle using the motor the system uses MG
 by itself to drive the vehicle.
+ Generates electricity using degenerative braking when decelerating the vehicle.
